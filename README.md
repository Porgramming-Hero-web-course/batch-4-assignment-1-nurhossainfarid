# Assignment1: Basic Problem Solving with TypeScript

This assignment covers core TypeScript concepts: data typing, interfaces, classes with inheritance, type checking, and data structure manipulation. Solutions highlight efficient, clear problem-solving using TypeScript


# Overview

 **Problem 01:** In this problem create a sumArray() function for calculate sum of all array element and use reduce() method for solve this problem.

 **Problem 02:** In this problem create a removeDuplicates() function for remove duplicates element from array and return new array. Here, Use filter() method for solve this problem.

**Problem 03:** In this problem create a countWordOccurrences() function for count how many time target word exist. Here filter() method for solve this problem.

**Problem 04:** In this problem create a calculateShapeArea() function for calculate the area based on the shape type.

**Problem 05:** In this problem create a getProperty() function for return the target property value. Here use keyof for check property name exists on the object

**Problem 06:** In this problem create a updateProfile() function for return the updated profile.

**Problem 07:** In this problem create a Car class include getCarAge that return the car's age based on the current year. 

**Problem 08:** In this problem create a validateKeys(obj: T, keys: (keyof T)[]) function that return true if all of the specified keys exist in the object, otherwise , it should return false. Here use every() method for solve this problem.

**Blog 01:** In this Blogs section, talk about The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.
